## üêû Problem
You need assistance with a programming task or feature, and you're looking for a solution to a specific problem. The exact nature of the issue isn't specified.

## üéØ Goal
To provide a solution that addresses the problem you're facing in your project. This solution should be clear, efficient, and maintainable. The ultimate goal is to make your code work as expected and improve the overall project.

## üí° Possible Solutions
Since the exact problem isn't described, here are some general approaches:
1. Debugging existing code to fix any errors.
2. Writing a new feature or function to add desired functionality.
3. Refactoring existing code to improve readability and efficiency.
4. Writing unit tests to ensure code reliability.

## üìã Steps to Solve the Problem
1. **Understand the Problem**: Clearly define the issue you're facing. If you haven't provided enough details, include more information about the problem, such as error messages, expected behavior, and current behavior.
2. **Plan the Solution**: Outline the steps needed to address the issue. This might include writing pseudocode, defining functions, or setting up test cases.
3. **Write the Code**: Implement the solution in the appropriate programming language.
4. **Test the Solution**: Ensure that the code works as expected by running tests or manually verifying the behavior.
5. **Review and Refactor**: Check the code for readability and efficiency. Make improvements where necessary.
6. **Submit Changes**: Add, commit, and push your changes to your repository. Submit a pull request with a description of the changes.
7. **Request Reviews**: Ask for reviews from your team or community to ensure the solution is robust.
8. **Celebrate**: Once the changes are approved and merged, celebrate your contribution!

If you provide more specific details about your issue, I can give you a more targeted solution. Here's how you can proceed:

1. Describe your problem in detail, including any error messages or unexpected behavior.
2. Provide the relevant code snippets or files that are causing the issue.
3. Specify the programming language and any relevant frameworks or libraries you're using.

### Example Scenario: Fixing a Bug in Python Code
Assuming you have a bug in a Python function, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Bug**: Look for error messages or unexpected behavior in your code.
2. **Isolate the Problem**: Find the specific part of the code where the bug occurs.
3. **Fix the Code**: Implement the necessary changes to correct the bug.
4. **Test the Solution**: Run tests to ensure the bug is fixed and no new issues are introduced.
5. **Submit Changes**: Add, commit, and push your changes. Submit a pull request for review.

### Example Code Fix
Here's an example of how you might fix a simple bug in a Python function:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Bug: Incorrectly handles string inputs
# Fix: Convert inputs to integers before adding
def add_numbers_fixed(a, b):
    try:
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        return a + b
    except ValueError:
        return "Invalid input"

# Testing the function
print(add_numbers_fixed(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add_numbers_fixed('2', '3'))  # Output: 5
print(add_numbers_fixed('two', 'three'))  # Output: Invalid input
```

### Next Steps
**a.** Provide specific details about the problem you're facing, including code snippets or error messages.
**b.** Let me know the programming language and any frameworks or libraries you're using so I can tailor the solution to your needs.
